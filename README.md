# RT6
My modifications on RT6 using MiraScripts.

In root, there is Excel file with all my notes, all settings which i wrote down by test and trial on my 508.
Please note, that almost all comments are in slovak language since i am slovakian:)
If You want to use my theme, You will have to modify Your EN (or other language file) mostly on lines marked "light blue" (TEXTS tab).
If You like the theme, upload it and then, if everything will be okay (but slovak :)) try to edit Your language file. To see it on Your RT6 is neccessary, so You can adjust the lenght of texts and so on.

The GPH_EDITOR is not included, download it Yourself, check for updates and then open the needed files.
Always make backups:)


There are some folders:
_WHAT_TO_COPY_TO_USB - contains all the neccessary files to upload my theme
        - CMD     - scripts itself - use first one 1_RT6_GPHCOPY - this is to upload files from Common, EN (or other lang),                         HARMxx to RT6. Please note, choose "reboot" after uploading.
        - HARMxx  - containing grapphic files of themes
        - EN      - contain only EN_GPH files - in my case, this is slovak GPH file renamed to EN (by saving it as - in GPH                         EDITOR).
        - Common  - very important file of the whole theme
        - and others, not so important :)

_GRAPPHIC_FILES - my photoshop edits, png files, and all others :))
